Here are some ideas I have been considering:

1. All three community groups are engaged in producing art of some form. Much like in an museum, could we create a map that takes the reader through the places/exhibits where community members produce/display their art work. This could look like mapping an entire neighborhood like how museum exhibits are mapped.

2. Looking at the responses provided by Sisters Unchained, I wonder if it's possible for us to work with the women from Sisters Unchained to explore their visions of Afro-futurist cities using mapping.      

3. The separation that mass incarceration produces has an overwhelming physical dimension because prisons are often built far away from where the families of those who are incarcerated live. Maybe another avenue for a project is an exploration of how city planning affects where prisons are built and how that produces physical separation, in the context of women from Sisters Unchained.

4. I think there is a lot of scope to experiment with sensory mapping. Is it possible to map tastes just like smells are mapped? And if so, would that also be a form of counter mapping? Latin Quarter in particular I think offers a lot of scope for exploring sensory mapping.
