The Aadhar card scheme, a policy by the Indian government to mandate unique identification cards for all its citizens, an attempt to make Indiaâ€™s 1.6 billion citizens legible, jumped to my mind as I read Seeing like a State. The scheme was controversial for a variety of reasons. The government insisted on collecting biometric data, implemented inadequate data protection measures, and denied welfare benefits to those without the Aadhar card. The consequences of denying welfare benefits were devastatingly severe, so much so that half of all starvation related deaths since 2015 can be attributed to the Aadhar card. The Aadhar card applications require documents that the most marginalized, often migrant workers, do not have. This exclusion is a reflection of the tendency the author describes to simply models. In this case, the idea of a person has been simplified and abstracted to a few documents and biometrics in order to make documentation easier, manufacturing a distinction among citizens that did not previously exist . 

Interestingly, the same government that wants to extensively collect data on citizens refuses to maintain any official database on religious hate crimes or conduct accurate surveys on manual scavenging. Control here is exercised through the data that is left undocumented as much it is through the data that is documented.
