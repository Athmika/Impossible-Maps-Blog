**Part-1**

While reading descriptions of Latin Square does provide insight, I think visiting the neighbourhood is important in order to develop a fuller understanding
of some of the descriptions the focus group has provided, especially since many of the strengths of Latin Square that the focus group outlined revolve
around sensory feelings like smells and tastes. We can also look more deeply into gentrification in the neighbourhood to analyze the policy decisions and
type of city planning that has caused prices to rise and place that in relation with the history of city planning in Boston since the Big Plans exhibit has
artifacts on city planning in Boston.

Viewing our work through the lens of principles outlined in the reading on counter mapping, I wonder what methods we can employ to keep our process of
knowledge production democratic and collaborative. How can we best engage the community groups so that the map objects we produce are co-created?
I also felt that with all three community groups there is so much historical and sociological context that I need to spend more time absorbing material before
I can start to think of maps in response.

**Part-2**

When I started reading the counter mapping paper, the terms described in the introduction like militant research or autonomous thinking seemed abstract,
but as I delved deeper into the paper, the case studies helped solidify those concepts and provided useful context. I especially found the description of the
processes that went into forming a collective and building the Disorientation Guides thought provoking. It’s not common for people engaged in research to
provide such thorough representations of their work processes. I think that open documentation is an intentional political statement - such transparency is in
direct odds with how scientists or engineers approach knowledge production. The highlighting of ethical considerations, the   “constant  questioning  and
conversations  within  the  collective  about  the  topic,  purpose  and  means  of  the initiative  at  hand” also stands out for its honesty and marks
an acknowledgement of uncertainty that is often absent in traditional approaches to knowledge production. As another reflection, I had never before considered
the distance between academia and activism in terms of geographical space, but after reading the paper I am thinking more critically about these omnipresent
effects of space. I also wonder what counter mapping at Olin would look like.


 I loved watching the documentary on designing plazas in New York City. I was surprised at how extensively research had been carried out, and how even small
 things like the patterns of sunlight reflection were studied in depth. Something so seemingly straightforward like plazas are so difficult to design because
 humans’ social behaviors are very difficult to predict. The observation methods that they used to document these behaviors, although effective,
 seemed highly time and resource intensive. I was again surprised at the sheer effort that went into designing something as seemingly simply as a plaza.
