        <p>I enjoyed reading Experimental Geography. I had never before considered the role of cartography in imperial conquest, that, as the the authors puts it, “if new territories were to be controlled they had to be mapped”. I wonder to what magnitude those effects translate to modern day imperial regimes and their use of mapping tools. Are the effects more pronounced as not only is there more data but also the data is now more exact?

<p>The first two readings took me longer to understand and process. Borges’s tale, picturing the crumbling of the empire through the crumbling of a tangible object, a 1:1  map, was comical, and I love how it reduced the empire to a piece of paper that can be shred and discarded, but I wonder if there is some broader commentary on the empire that the author was hinting at, or if I am missing out on some idea behind the nature of science or geography that the author communicated through the tale. To understand the piece by Bauldirllard, I had to do some additional reading to understand what he means by the “Simularca”. His conception that simulations create reality, that maps don’t “precede the territory”, that the map in Borges tale is not a mirror but a being in itself, seems detached, in the sense, that it almost rejects all materialistic conceptions of the world, which I had trouble wrapping my head around.</p>
