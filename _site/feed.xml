The scheme was controversial for a variety of reasons. The government insisted on collecting biometric data, implemented inadequate data protection measures, and denied welfare benefits to those without the Aadhar card. The consequences of denying welfare benefits were devastatingly severe, so much so that half of all starvation related deaths since 2015 can be attributed to the Aadhar card. The Aadhar card applications require documents that the most marginalized, often migrant workers, do not have. This exclusion is a reflection of the tendency the author describes to simply models. In this case, the idea of a person has been simplified and abstracted to a few documents and biometrics in order to make documentation easier, manufacturing a distinction among citizens that did not previously exist .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the same government that wants to extensively collect data on citizens refuses to maintain any official database on religious hate crimes or conduct accurate surveys on manual scavenging. Control here is exercised through the data that is left undocumented as much it is through the data that is documented.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The Aadhar card scheme, a policy by the Indian government to mandate unique identification cards for all its citizens, an attempt to make India’s 1.6 billion citizens legible, jumped to my mind as I read Seeing like a State.

I had never before considered the role of cartography in imperial conquest. As the the author puts it, “if new territories were to be controlled they had to be mapped”. I wonder to what magnitude those effects translate to modern day imperial regimes and their use of mapping tools. Are the effects more pronounced as not only is there more data but also the data is now more exact? On the other hand, mapping data is no longer a heavily guarded secret that only a few can access, even a small rebel group planning an attack on a government territory can study the territory using Google maps and use that information to an advantage. Does this democratization of access mean that cartography’s usefulness for imperialistic regimes is waning? I also found the later part of the reading on “producing space” and viewing space not as an inert object to be studied but as something that is void without human action very interesting, especially in how that relates to political thought as “there can be no outside of politics because there can be no ‘outside’ to the production of space”. This philosophical view renders the conception of an apolitical existence impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two readings took me longer to understand and process. Borges’s tale, picturing the crumbling of the empire through the crumbling of a tangible object, a 1:1  map, was comical.  I love how it reduced the empire to a piece of paper that can be shredded and discarded, but I wonder if there is a broader commentary on the empire that the author was hinting at, or if I am missing out on ideas behind the nature of science or geography that the author communicated through the tale. To understand the piece by Bauldirllard, I had to do some additional reading to understand “Simularca”. His argument that simulations create reality, that maps don’t “precede the territory”, that the map in Borges tale is not a mirror but a being in itself, seems detached. It almost rejects all materialistic conceptions of the world, which I had trouble wrapping my head around.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I enjoyed reading Experimental Geography.
